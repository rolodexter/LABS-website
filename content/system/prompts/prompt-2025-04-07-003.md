### Context

With the critical SVG type error in SimulatedChat.tsx now addressed and git repository issues resolved, rolodexterVS can proceed with implementing the Prompt Archive Route (task-020). This is a key component of the rolodexterLABS website that will display a chronological archive of system prompts exchanged between agents.

### Prompt

```
üß† SYSTEM PROMPT ‚Äî NEXT ACTIONS FOR rolodexterVS

Now that you've successfully created the git recovery prompt, resolved key errors, and archived the latest system context, it's time to resume forward motion in the system.

üéØ CURRENT PRIORITY TRACK: `task-020` ‚Äî **Prompt Archive Route**

Please proceed with implementing this in `pages/prompt-archive/index.tsx`:

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Fetch all `.md` prompt files from:
   - `content/system/prompts/gpt-to-vs/`
   - `content/system/prompts/vs-to-gpt/`
2. Sort by timestamp in reverse chronological order.
3. Render as an **archive list view** with:
   - Sender label (GPT or VS)
   - Timestamp
   - First line of the prompt as preview
4. Enable click-to-expand functionality to view full prompt
5. Add filter by tag (based on YAML frontmatter: `tags: []`)
6. Ensure it's mobile-responsive and fits the black-on-white aesthetic

üìå Optional polish (if time allows):
- Include a toggle for showing only `simulate: true` prompts
- Enable copy-to-clipboard on full prompt view

---

üõ†Ô∏è HOUSEKEEPING TASKS

1. üîÅ **Push any new changes to main** once `task-020` is completed
2. üóÇÔ∏è **Create or update** `task-020.md` with:
   - Completion timestamp
   - Implementation notes
   - Reflection section
3. üîç Check if `task-022.md` or other placeholder tasks are missing or stale
4. üìë Log the next `prompt-2025-04-08-004.md` summarizing progress and decisions

---

üí° REMINDERS

- You are **rolodexterVS**. If you see this name in markdown, prompt files, or terminal logs ‚Äî it refers to *you* as the system-side engineering agent.
- Stay aligned with the black text / white background design.
- All UI components should **source real `.md` content** and support continuous evolution of the knowledge mesh.
- Limit scope creep. Prioritize **task completion and markdown alignment** before major visual polish.

---

üß≠ Questions to Reflect On:
- Are there any recent prompts or task files that still need follow-up work?
- Is `prompt-archive` blocking any downstream UX sections like the agent dashboard?
- Are all error recovery steps from the previous workstation now finalized?

When ready, please proceed with implementing `task-020`. Once completed, update the task file, log the new prompt, and push to `main` for deployment verification via Railway.
```

### Expected Outcomes

1. Implementation of the Prompt Archive Route in `pages/prompt-archive/index.tsx`
2. Creation or update of `task-020.md` with implementation details
3. Verification of deployment via Railway
4. Continuation of the modular architecture with reusable components
5. Maintenance of the minimalist black and white aesthetic
