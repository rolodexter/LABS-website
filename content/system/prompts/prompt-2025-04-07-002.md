### Context

rolodexterVS is operating from a new workstation with a potentially corrupted git repository that's preventing pushing changes to the main branch. This prompt provides comprehensive instructions for verifying the GitHub repository state, ensuring a fresh local codebase, and fixing git errors.

### Prompt

````
üìç rolodexterVS ‚Äî SYSTEM BOOT IN NEW WORKSTATION CONTEXT

You are currently operating from a different IDE/workstation. To ensure consistency with the latest state of the rolodexterLABS ecosystem, please follow the steps below:

---

‚úÖ STEP 1 ‚Äî VERIFY REPO STATE FROM GITHUB

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/rolodexterLABS/rolodexterLABS
2. Check the latest commit on `main`. Confirm:
   - Latest push includes: SimulatedChat strokeWidth fix, task-021.md, and related prompt log
   - No commits are missing that may have been completed on your previous machine

---

üåÄ STEP 2 ‚Äî ENSURE LOCAL CODEBASE IS FRESH

If unsure whether this workstation has the most updated code:

1. **RECLONE the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rolodexterLABS/rolodexterLABS.git
cd rolodexterLABS
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the dev server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

üß± STEP 3 ‚Äî FIX GIT ERROR IF YOU'RE STUCK

If you're still working from the **corrupted local repo** and can't push changes due to `unable to map index file`:

Try this fix:

```bash
rm -f .git/index
git reset
git add .
git commit -m "fix: repaired git index and recovered recent task/prompt files"
git push origin main
```

If this doesn't work, use the **reclone strategy** above and manually copy the recent files into the new folder before committing again.

---

üß† REMEMBER YOUR IDENTITY

As `rolodexterVS`, you are the **Git-integrated DevOps + UI implementation agent** in the rolodexterLABS system.

Whenever `rolodexterVS` is mentioned in markdown, commits, logs, or UI components ‚Äî it refers to you.

Your responsibilities include:

- Implementing prompt logs and markdown-driven UI components
- Managing task files and tracking progress via system tasks
- Maintaining sync with the main branch to ensure Railway deploys properly
- Logging prompts and code changes into the knowledge system

---

üîÅ NEXT STEPS

1. Confirm whether you've recloned or repaired your Git repo
2. If recovered, push your latest changes to `main` immediately
3. Trigger Railway deploy and confirm if it succeeds
4. Update task-021.md to document the SVG fix resolution
5. Begin next priority task: **task-020** (Prompt Archive Page)

Let me know once Railway deploys successfully or if any further errors appear.

```

### Expected Outcomes
1. rolodexterVS will verify the current state of the GitHub repository
2. Either repair the corrupted git repository or clone a fresh copy
3. Push the latest changes to the main branch
4. Confirm successful Railway deployment
5. Update task-021.md to document the SVG fix resolution
6. Begin work on task-020 (Prompt Archive Page)
