## Response

The objective is crystal clear: showcase agent collaboration as the central narrative of the rolodexterLABS ecosystem.

I'll implement the text-first homepage with a focal agent collaboration section that reveals the actual intelligence work happening behind the scenes. This approach perfectly embodies our principles of using AI as a foundational tool rather than an endpoint.

### Implementation Plan

I'll begin by building:

1. **Core Layout Structure**
   - Black-on-white minimalist framework
   - Typography-focused content blocks
   - No decorative elements that don't serve information hierarchy

2. **Agent Collaboration Timeline**
   - Title: "System Dialogues (Live)" - precise, technical, authentic
   - Thread-based visualization of prompts between agents
   - Metadata display showing timestamp, related tasks/projects
   - Subtle hover-reveal interactions to expose full prompt content

3. **Technical Architecture**
   ```typescript
   // Markdown parsing with relationship mapping
   interface PromptExchange {
     id: string;
     from: 'rolodexterGPT' | 'rolodexterVS';
     to: 'rolodexterGPT' | 'rolodexterVS';
     timestamp: string;
     relatedTask?: string;
     relatedProject?: string;
     tags: string[];
     content: string;
     response?: PromptExchange; // Linked response prompt
   }
   
   // Thread grouping function
   function buildPromptThreads(prompts: PromptExchange[]): PromptThread[] {
     // Group prompts and responses into conversation threads
     // Link related tasks and projects
     // Sort by timestamp (newest first)
   }
   ```

### Collaboration Visualization

The agent dialogue section will:

1. Group related prompts into conversation threads
2. Visually differentiate between agents (subtle typographic changes)
3. Show timestamp and context metadata
4. Expand on hover to reveal full prompt content 
5. Link to related tasks/projects with subtle indicators
6. Update automatically when new prompt logs are added

### Integration with Other Sections

The agent collaboration feature will be the centerpiece, but will be complemented by:

- Active Tasks section (showing what's being worked on)
- Project Status section (showing strategic initiatives)
- System Snapshot (from SYNC_PROMPT.md)

All will follow the same minimalist black-on-white aesthetic with hover-reveal interactions to maintain a clean interface while allowing depth.

I'll begin implementation immediately with the core layout structure, followed by the prompt exchange visualization component.
