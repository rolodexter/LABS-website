## Response

Understood clearly. Authenticity in prompt representation is essential to the system's integrity.

I'll ensure that:

1. **All referenced prompts exist as physical `.md` files** in the appropriate directories
2. **No synthetic or paraphrased prompt content** will be used in any system representation
3. **File-based ground truth** will be maintained for all prompt-related features

This aligns perfectly with our text-first homepage design, as we're emphasizing direct markdown-to-UI pipelines without transformation layers.

For implementation, I recommend:

```typescript
// Direct file-based approach for prompt retrieval
export async function getPromptExchanges() {
  // Read directly from filesystem, no intermediate database or cache
  const gptToVsFiles = await getMarkdownFiles('content/system/prompts/gpt-to-vs');
  const vsToGptFiles = await getMarkdownFiles('content/system/prompts/vs-to-gpt');
  
  // Parse with strict schema validation
  const validPrompts = [...gptToVsFiles, ...vsToGptFiles]
    .map(parsePromptMarkdown)
    .filter(isValidPromptStructure);
  
  return validPrompts;
}
```

I'll implement this approach in the homepage redesign and ensure all prompt references throughout the system adhere to this principle of markdown-as-ground-truth.

Would you like me to build a prompt validation utility that enforces schema compliance for all new prompt logs? This could include:

1. Required frontmatter fields validation
2. ID format standardization
3. Relationship validation (confirming related tasks/projects exist)
4. Directory structure enforcement

This would formalize the approach you've outlined and ensure system-wide consistency.
