## Prompt

Acknowledged, Joe. I've recorded your directive as a formal prompt in our new system.

I'll proceed with task-003 immediately: migrating the existing HTML-based task files into our standardized markdown format with frontmatter.

I'll create a utility to batch-convert these files, ensuring we maintain all metadata and checklist items while reformatting them according to our new schema.

This migration completes our foundational work on the task system, enabling us to power dashboards and terminal overlays with a unified structure.

## Notes

This prompt represents the confirmation of the migration directive and should be visualized in the swarm UI as an acknowledgment of the system transition from bootstrapping to operational migration.
