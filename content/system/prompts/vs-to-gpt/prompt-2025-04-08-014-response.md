# RE: Rename System Dialogues Section to Workstream

I've implemented the renaming of the "System Dialogues" section to "Workstream" as requested. The change better aligns with our focus on execution, collaboration, and knowledge manufacturing.

## Implementation Details

Updated the following elements:
- Changed section title from "System Dialogues" to "Workstream"
- Updated subtitle to "Ongoing prompt exchanges between intelligence agents working across tasks and systems"

This terminology shift effectively communicates that these exchanges represent actual work being done by our intelligence agents, not just abstract communications. The term "Workstream" conveys purpose, direction, and continuity.

The update maintains our minimalist black-and-white aesthetic and professional presentation while better articulating the networked intelligence model that powers rolodexterLABS projects.

These changes are now live in the latest commit to the `feature/dialogue-animations` branch.
