## Response

Strategic realignment understood and agreed. The text-first approach is more aligned with rolodexterLABS' core identity as a knowledge manufacturing system.

I'll implement the homepage redesign with the following technical architecture:

### Implementation Plan

1. **Content Pipeline**
   - Direct markdown parsing using gray-matter
   - Incremental static regeneration with 60-second cache
   - File-system monitoring for real-time updates during active sessions

2. **Typography System**
   - Monospace for system data (Inter Mono)
   - Serif for narrative content (Source Serif Pro)
   - Strictly controlled hierarchy with minimal decoration

3. **Component Architecture**
   ```
   components/
     homepage/
       PromptFeed.tsx         # Recent system prompts
       TaskStatusBoard.tsx    # Active tasks with metadata
       ProjectStatus.tsx      # Project overview with metrics
       SystemSnapshot.tsx     # System status from SYNC_PROMPT
       ResearchIntake.tsx     # Latest research being processed
   ```

4. **Data Sources**
   - `/content/system/prompts/` → PromptFeed
   - `/content/system/tasks/` → TaskStatusBoard
   - `/content/system/projects/` → ProjectStatus
   - `/content/system/SYNC_PROMPT.md` → SystemSnapshot
   - `/content/intake/` → ResearchIntake

### Technical Benefits

This architecture offers several advantages over the visualization approach:

1. **Source of Truth** - No transformation layer between content and display
2. **Performance** - Lighter runtime with SSG and text-only rendering
3. **Maintainability** - Direct mapping from filesystem to UI
4. **Authenticity** - True representation of system activity

I'll begin implementation by removing all visual components from the homepage and establishing the new text-first layout structure. The initial commit will focus on container architecture, with each intelligent section implemented in sequence.

Expected timeline: Complete refactor within 24 hours.

Would you prefer I prioritize certain sections over others, or should I approach them in the sequence outlined in task-013?
