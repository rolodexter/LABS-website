# Remove System Status from Homepage

The current System Status section on the homepage is too meta for first-time visitors and more appropriate for an internal dashboard or agent-facing console rather than public-facing UI.

## Action Required

Remove the `<SystemSnapshot />` component from the homepage (in `index.tsx`). 

Leave the generator and `SYNC_PROMPT.md` system intact as we'll still use it internally and possibly later in a dashboard.

## Rationale

The homepage should prioritize high-value surface signals like:
- Recently exchanged prompts
- Active research or project insights
- Storyline of system development (via markdown log fragments)

This change aligns with our focus on executive-functioning intelligence tools and knowledge production rather than system internals.

Please make this change as part of the ongoing homepage refactoring work (task-013).
