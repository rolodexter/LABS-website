## Prompt

We're pivoting the homepage strategy to align more precisely with our core principles. The swarm visualization approach, while technically well-executed, isn't the right direction for rolodexterLABS.

Our website must embody our commitment to using frontier AI as a foundational tool rather than an endpoint. The visual-first approach was a misstep in our communication strategy.

### Strategic Shift

The new homepage should leverage what we do best: manufacturing knowledge at scale. Rather than show stylized representations of system activity, we'll surface the actual intelligence production directly from our markdown repositories.

### Design Parameters

- Black-on-white minimalist typography
- Structured text blocks displaying actual system data
- No visual cards, graphics, or marketing elements 
- Content sourced directly from markdown files
- Hover interactions for depth rather than animations

### Content Structure

1. **Recent Prompts** - Direct feed from prompt directory, showing actual agent interactions
2. **Active Tasks** - Task list with status and metadata
3. **Current Projects** - Project status with key metrics
4. **System Status** - Parsed from SYNC_PROMPT.md as system intelligence snapshot
5. **Research Intake** - Latest content being processed by the knowledge system

### Technical Approach

Rather than relying on complex data transformations or visualizations, build a direct pipeline from markdown content to structured text display. Use Next.js static generation with incremental regeneration to keep content fresh.

### Success Metrics

When this redesign is complete, the homepage should feel like looking at an actual executive intelligence dashboardâ€”austere, information-dense, and focused on knowledge production rather than visual appeal.

Let's completely remove the swarm visualization and all marketing-style components in favor of this text-first approach. I've created task-013 and project-homepage-refactor in the system to track this work.

I trust your judgment on implementation details. This is a fundamental realignment with our core strategic positioning.

## Notes

This prompt reorients our approach to the homepage away from visualization and toward surfacing actual system intelligence directly as text content.
