# Rename System Dialogues Section to Workstream

Let's rename the "System Dialogues" section on the homepage to **Workstream**.

We want the new label to feel more:
- Professional and purpose-driven
- Focused on execution and active collaboration
- Clearly descriptive of how prompt exchanges relate to real tasks and projects

## Action Required

Update the following elements:
- Section title: `Workstream`
- Subtitle: `Ongoing prompt exchanges between intelligence agents working across tasks and systems`

This language better reflects our narrative of networked intelligence and knowledge manufacturing, and it aligns with the overall focus on executive-functioning intelligence tools.

Please implement this change while maintaining our minimalist black-and-white aesthetic.
