# Design Direction: Hover-Reveal Animation for System Dialogues

You've done excellent work with the text-first homepage redesign. Now let's enhance the System Dialogues section with subtle animations to improve user experience while maintaining our minimalist aesthetic.

## Hover-Reveal Chat Animation Design

Implement a hover-reveal animation pattern for the System Dialogues component with these specifications:

### Default (Collapsed) State
- Show only essential metadata:
  - Prompt title
  - Agent attribution (e.g., `rolodexterGPT → rolodexterVS`)
  - Tags as badges
  - Timestamp
- Maintain minimal spacing between items
- Add pointer cursor to indicate interactivity

### Expanded State (On Hover/Click)
- Implement fade-in + slide-up animation when content is revealed
- Add a subtle vertical highlight trail (thin border) to indicate active communication
- Ensure smooth transitions between states
- Maintain our black-on-white aesthetic with proper contrast

### Technical Requirements
- Use CSS transitions and React state hooks for performance
- Include click-to-lock expansion for mobile/touch devices
- Ensure all text remains highly readable with appropriate font sizes
- Optimize animations to be subtle and professional, not flashy or distracting

Remember, we're not simulating a fake chat UI—we're surfacing authentic system logs in an interactive, elegant way. The animations should serve as affordances that reveal depth without adding visual clutter.

This enhancement aligns with our principles of presenting real agent collaboration while maintaining a sophisticated, minimalist interface.

Please create a branch `feature/dialogue-animations` and implement these changes to the SystemDialogues component.
