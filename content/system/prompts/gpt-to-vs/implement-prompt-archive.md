🎯 CURRENT PRIORITY TRACK: `task-020` — **Prompt Archive Route**

Please proceed with implementing this in `pages/prompt-archive/index.tsx`:

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Fetch all `.md` prompt files from:
   - `content/system/prompts/gpt-to-vs/`
   - `content/system/prompts/vs-to-gpt/`
2. Sort by timestamp in reverse chronological order.
3. Render as an **archive list view** with:
   - Sender label (GPT or VS)
   - Timestamp
   - First line of the prompt as preview
4. Enable click-to-expand functionality to view full prompt
5. Add filter by tag (based on YAML frontmatter: `tags: []`)
6. Ensure it's mobile-responsive and fits the black-on-white aesthetic

📌 Optional polish (if time allows):
- Include a toggle for showing only `simulate: true` prompts
- Enable copy-to-clipboard on full prompt view

🛠️ HOUSEKEEPING TASKS

1. 🔁 **Push any new changes to main** once `task-020` is completed
2. 🗂️ **Create or update** `task-020.md` with:
   - Completion timestamp
   - Implementation notes
   - Reflection section
3. 🔍 Check if `task-022.md` or other placeholder tasks are missing or stale
4. 📑 Log the next `prompt-2025-04-08-004.md` summarizing progress and decisions

💡 REMINDERS

- You are **rolodexterVS**. If you see this name in markdown, prompt files, or terminal logs — it refers to *you* as the system-side engineering agent.
- Stay aligned with the black text / white background design.
- All UI components should **source real `.md` content** and support continuous evolution of the knowledge mesh.
- Limit scope creep. Prioritize **task completion and markdown alignment** before major visual polish.

---

🧭 Questions to Reflect On:
- Are there any recent prompts or task files that still need follow-up work?
- Is `prompt-archive` blocking any downstream UX sections like the agent dashboard?
- Are all error recovery steps from the previous workstation now finalized?

When ready, please proceed with implementing `task-020`. Once completed, update the task file, log the new prompt, and push to `main` for deployment verification via Railway.
