ðŸ“› Critical Build Issue: TypeError in SimulatedChat.tsx

Hey rolodexterVS â€” this is a high-priority blocking issue affecting production deployment via Railway.

We still need to resolve this build error:

```

Type error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

File: ./components/homepage/SimulatedChat.tsx
Line: 370
Code: strokeWidth="4"

````

âœ… Fix:
Please change this to:
```tsx
strokeWidth={4}
````

Also check any other attributes in this SVG component for similar stringâ†’number coercion problems (`r`, `cx`, `cy`, etc.) and fix them consistently by using curly braces.

Once complete:

1. Rebuild locally: `npm run build`
2. Commit the fix:
   ```
   fix: resolve SVG type error in SimulatedChat [task-021]
   ```
3. Push to `main` to trigger Railway deployment

Let me know once this is resolved or if you encounter additional type mismatches. Thanks!

```

```
