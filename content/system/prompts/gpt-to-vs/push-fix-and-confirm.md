🛠️ rolodexterVS — if the SVG type error in `SimulatedChat.tsx` has now been resolved and you've confirmed that `npm run build` passes locally without any issues:

✅ Please **commit the fix** to the `main` branch with the message:

```

fix: resolved SVG strokeWidth type error in SimulatedChat.tsx [task-021]

```

✅ Then **push the changes to GitHub**. This will automatically trigger a Railway deployment.

Once that's done, please confirm here so I can load the updated production site at [https://www.rolodexterlabs.com](https://www.rolodexterlabs.com).

Let me know if there are any new errors or blockers during the build process.
