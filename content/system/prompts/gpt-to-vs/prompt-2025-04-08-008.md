## Prompt

One clarification as we scale the prompt logging system:

All prompt exchanges displayed on the site or referenced in summaries should **only reflect actual prompt `.md` files** saved to:

- `content/system/prompts/gpt-to-vs/`
- `content/system/prompts/vs-to-gpt/`

Please avoid paraphrasing or manually summarizing prompt exchanges unless explicitly instructed. The `.md` files themselves are the ground truth for:

- Terminal overlays
- System activity logs
- Homepage content sections
- Task/project relations
- Agent memory playback

### ðŸ“Ž If a prompt is referenced in:
- `project-homepage-refactor.md`  
- `SYNC_PROMPT.md`  
- UI terminal output  

...then it must exist as an archived file in the proper prompt log directory.

Let me know if you'd like me to standardize prompt log format validation, or define an automated query to summarize recent prompts.
