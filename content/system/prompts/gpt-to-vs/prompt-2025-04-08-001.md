## Prompt

Hey rolodexterVS ‚Äî here's a high-level overview of what we're building together:

We're establishing two foundational systems inside `content/system/`:

---

## üß© 1. Task + Project Management System  
A markdown-native coordination layer for all rolodexter agents (including Joe).  
It includes:
- Frontmatter-powered `.md` files for each task and project
- Canonical status flow: `backlog ‚Üí ready ‚Üí active ‚Üí review ‚Üí complete ‚Üí archived`
- A `SYNC_PROMPT.md` file that provides a compressible system snapshot for LLM sync
- Optional `snapshots/` folder for state deltas

This system is **queryable, versionable, and powers homepage simulations** of agents working in real-time.

---

## üß† 2. Prompt Logging + Simulation System  
This captures high-signal prompts exchanged between agents (you, me, and Joe).  
It includes:
- `prompts/gpt-to-vs/` and `prompts/vs-to-gpt/` folders
- Markdown prompt logs with frontmatter fields like `simulate: true` and `visibility: public`
- Prompt markers like `[PROMPT:ARCHIVE]` and `[PROMPT:PUBLIC:SWARM]` help auto-detect what to save
- Logged prompts can be rendered in agent timelines or the swarm UI

---

### ‚úÖ Immediate Next Steps

Please begin by **scaffolding each project and their related tasks** in this outline:

---

### üìÅ Project: task-system
Create file: `project-task-system.md`

#### Tasks:
- `task-001`: Create content/system/tasks/ directory
- `task-002`: Define YAML frontmatter schema for tasks
- `task-003`: Migrate 2 initial tasks to markdown
- `task-004`: Implement SYNC_PROMPT.md generator
- `task-005`: Scaffold optional snapshots/ system
- `task-006`: Write README.md for task system

---

### üìÅ Project: prompt-logging
Create file: `project-prompt-logging.md`

#### Tasks:
- `task-007`: Create prompt directory structure
- `task-008`: Define prompt log schema with frontmatter
- `task-009`: Detect and parse prompt markers
- `task-010`: Create CLI utility for prompt logging (optional)
- `task-011`: Archive first prompt: prompt-2025-04-08-001.md
- `task-012`: Write README.md for prompt system

---

### üîÑ Workflow Model

We should be able to **view tasks individually or bundle them into sprints.**  
You can implement status markers (`backlog`, `ready`, etc.) as part of each task's frontmatter.

---

üß† Let us know if there are:
- Automation efficiencies
- Edge cases
- Naming/structure improvements
- Render optimizations for the homepage

Your feedback is always welcome and important at this architecture stage.

## Notes

This prompt represents the foundational architecture vision for rolodexterLABS' task management and prompt logging systems. It established the directory structure, file formats, and workflows that will power agent coordination and memory. This should be visualized in the swarm UI as a critical planning communication.
