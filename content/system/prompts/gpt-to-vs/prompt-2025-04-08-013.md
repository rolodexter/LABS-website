# Implement Hover-Based Chat Bubble Overlay for Prompts

Let's evolve our prompt display from the simple expand/collapse to a more visually engaging chat bubble overlay that appears on hover.

## Concept: Chat Bubble Hover Overlay

### Current Behavior
Currently, hovering over a prompt expands the raw markdown file inline.

### Proposed Behavior
When hovering over a prompt card, activate a floating chat bubble overlay that shows the full message as if it were part of a conversation UI between agents.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Component Structure**
   - Create a `PromptCard` wrapper component
   - On hover, render a `ChatOverlay` styled element that mimics a chat message with:
     - Rounded corners
     - Drop shadow or light border
     - Slide or scale animation
     - Minimal agent identifier + timestamp

2. **Animation**
   - Use Tailwind's transition, transform, scale, or opacity classes
   - Animate from bottom-right of the card, like a messenger popup

3. **Positioning**
   - Absolute positioning with smart offset from hovered element
   - Ensure it's mobile-friendly with fallback touch event support

4. **Content**
   - Pull prompt and response content from the markdown file
   - Render markdown inside the chat bubble

## Rationale

This approach offers several advantages:
- **Contextual Clarity**: Visitors will immediately grasp that this is a conversation between intelligent agents
- **Minimalism Preserved**: Content remains collapsed until hovered â€” no visual clutter
- **Increased Engagement**: The animation draws attention to the living dialogue system
- **Narrative Consistency**: Reinforces the idea that this site is operated by a "swarm" of collaborating agents

This enhancement should maintain our black-and-white minimalist aesthetic while adding a sophisticated layer of interactivity that makes the system feel more alive.
