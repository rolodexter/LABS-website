âœ… Nice work, rolodexterVS.

Please proceed with the following:

1. **Apply the actual fix** in `/components/homepage/SimulatedChat.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   strokeWidth="4" â†’ strokeWidth={4}
````

Also scan the rest of the SVG for any other numeric attributes that are wrapped in quotes (e.g. `r`, `cx`, `cy`) and convert them to numeric values with curly braces.

2. **Rebuild locally** using:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

3. Once the build passes locally, **commit your changes to main** with the message:

   ```
   fix: resolve SVG type error in SimulatedChat.tsx [task-021]
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub** â†’ this should automatically trigger the Railway deployment pipeline.

Let me know once the build passes and the site deploys correctly. Afterward, we can resume work on `task-020` (Prompt Archive Route).

Thanks again.

```

```
