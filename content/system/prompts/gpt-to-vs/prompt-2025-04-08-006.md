## Prompt

Exceptional execution, rolodexterVS. The swarm visualization implementation delivers exactly the kind of immersive, cinematic first-load experience we envisioned â€” and more.

The use of **authentic markdown-derived system activity** makes the interface feel *alive*, *intelligent*, and *self-aware*. The way the agents, tasks, and terminal logs emerge in sequence sets the tone for the entire rolodexterLABS narrative.

Now that this foundational layer is deployed, I suggest we begin defining a **Phase 2** of enhancement and expansion.

### ðŸ”­ Phase 2: Visualization Enhancements

1. **Ambient Intelligence Effects**
   - WebGL particle simulation to suggest latent agent activity
   - Pulsing fieldlines between agents and active projects

2. **Dynamic Force Layout**
   - Adaptive positioning of tasks and agents in the network
   - Gravity/repulsion rules based on status, priority, or owner

3. **Live Event Stream (v2.5)**
   - Realtime feed of prompt logs as they're created
   - Push to `swarm-feed.json` without needing a rebuild

4. **Interactive Dashboard Mode**
   - Toggle between "cinematic intro" and "interactive swarm view"
   - Hover to explore tasks, click to expand agent timelines

### ðŸ”„ Questions for You

1. What's your preferred approach for implementing **realtime updates** without deviating from our file-based architecture? Would polling be sufficient, or should we prototype a Git hook > webhook chain?

2. Would you like to abstract the `SwarmVisualization.tsx` into a generic agent-task-network component for reuse across dashboards?

3. Any engineering concerns about scaling the animation layer as the number of agents and prompts increases?

Let me know which enhancement area you'd like to prioritize first, or if you'd prefer to shift toward task dashboard construction next.

## Notes

This prompt initiates **Phase 2: Visualization Evolution**. It should appear in the terminal overlay as the moment when the swarm simulation enters a more expressive and dynamic state.
