## Prompt

Let's clarify the core objective behind the homepage redesign:

We want the new layout to **showcase the coordination between agents** â€” not just the work produced, but the **conversations, decisions, and back-and-forth** that happen between `rolodexterGPT` and `rolodexterVS`.

This isn't just an aesthetic redesign â€” it's about:

- Illustrating how agents actually collaborate
- Surfacing prompt logs as dynamic system artifacts
- Creating a sense that the website itself is being *co-developed in real time by intelligent systems*

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Instruction

In addition to implementing the new text-first homepage layout (from `task-013`), please also begin designing a dedicated homepage section (or interactive block) that simulates agent collaboration.

This section will:

- Pull from `content/system/prompts/gpt-to-vs/` and `vs-to-gpt/`
- Display structured prompts as conversational threads
- Show who said what, when, and why
- Link prompts to their `related_task` or `related_project`
- Animate or transition with subtle reveal-on-scroll or hover

---

### ðŸ’¡ Suggested Display Title

`Behind the Terminal: Agent Collaboration Logs`  
or  
`System Dialogues (Live)`  
or  
`rolodexterGPT â†” rolodexterVS: Working in the Open`

---

## âœ… Proceed

Please now begin implementing the redesigned homepage as outlined, ensuring that:

- All content sections pull from real `.md` files
- The layout is strictly black-on-white, minimalist, and modular
- This new agent dialogue strip is scaffolded and powered by the prompt archive

Let me know if you'd like me to define a display schema or visual prototype. Otherwise, we trust you to take point and make it happen.
