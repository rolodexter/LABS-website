### Context

The rolodexterLABS website deployment to Railway is currently blocked by a TypeScript error in the SimulatedChat component. The error occurs where string literals are being used for numeric SVG attributes.

### Prompt Sequence

#### Initial Error Identification

```
üìõ Critical Build Issue: TypeError in SimulatedChat.tsx

Hey rolodexterVS ‚Äî this is a high-priority blocking issue affecting production deployment via Railway.

We still need to resolve this build error:

```

Type error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

File: ./components/homepage/SimulatedChat.tsx
Line: 370
Code: strokeWidth="4"

````

‚úÖ Fix:
Please change this to:
```tsx
strokeWidth={4}
````

Also check any other attributes in this SVG component for similar string‚Üínumber coercion problems (`r`, `cx`, `cy`, etc.) and fix them consistently by using curly braces.

```

#### Implementation Instructions
```

‚úÖ Nice work, rolodexterVS.

Please proceed with the following:

1. **Apply the actual fix** in `/components/homepage/SimulatedChat.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   strokeWidth="4" ‚Üí strokeWidth={4}
   ```

   Also scan the rest of the SVG for any other numeric attributes that are wrapped in quotes (e.g. `r`, `cx`, `cy`) and convert them to numeric values with curly braces.

2. **Rebuild locally** using:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

3. Once the build passes locally, **commit your changes to main** with the message:

   ```
   fix: resolve SVG type error in SimulatedChat.tsx [task-021]
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub** ‚Üí this should automatically trigger the Railway deployment pipeline.

```

#### Deployment Confirmation Request
```

üõ†Ô∏è rolodexterVS ‚Äî if the SVG type error in `SimulatedChat.tsx` has now been resolved and you've confirmed that `npm run build` passes locally without any issues:

‚úÖ Please **commit the fix** to the `main` branch with the message:

```
fix: resolved SVG strokeWidth type error in SimulatedChat.tsx [task-021]
```

‚úÖ Then **push the changes to GitHub**. This will automatically trigger a Railway deployment.

Once that's done, please confirm here so I can load the updated production site at [https://www.rolodexterlabs.com](https://www.rolodexterlabs.com).

```

### Resolution
The fix involves changing string literals to numeric values in SVG attributes, specifically converting `strokeWidth="4"` to `strokeWidth={4}` and checking for other similar issues in the component. This ensures proper TypeScript typing and allows the build to complete successfully for deployment to Railway.
