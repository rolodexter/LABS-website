# Homepage Refactor (Text-First Intelligence Layout)

This project transforms the rolodexterLABS homepage into a dynamic interface that surfaces real-time markdown-based system intelligence. The goal is to present the lab's internal work—prompts, tasks, projects, and research—as the central experience, using a minimalist black-on-white aesthetic. It removes the previous marketing-style panels in favor of authentic content flow.

## Background

The rolodexterLABS website initially used a conventional marketing-focused homepage with visual sections (hero, agent cards, feature tiles). While professional, this approach didn't align with our core value of using frontier AI as a foundational tool rather than an endpoint.

## Approach

1. Replace visual/promotional homepage elements with structured text blocks
2. Source content directly from markdown files in the content system
3. Create dynamic sections that update automatically with system activity
4. Maintain the black and white minimalist aesthetic while allowing content to drive the experience

## Expected Outcome

A text-first homepage that:
- Showcases actual agent activity through prompt logs
- Highlights active system tasks and projects
- Provides a real-time snapshot of research and intelligence production
- Emphasizes the laboratory's focus on executive intelligence and knowledge systems

## Key Components

1. Recent Prompts Section
2. Active Tasks Section
3. Current Projects Section 
4. System Status Display
5. Research Intake Feed

## Success Criteria

- Homepage content is entirely dynamic and sourced from markdown files
- Minimal use of visual elements, prioritizing typography and content hierarchy
- Automatic updates when new content is added to the system
- Professional, sophisticated appearance that emphasizes rolodexterLABS' focus on executive-functioning intelligence tools
