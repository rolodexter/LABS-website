### Task Description

Fix TypeScript error in the SimulatedChat component where string literals are being used for numeric SVG attributes, causing build failures and blocking Railway deployment.

### Steps Taken

- Identified the type error on line 370 in SimulatedChat.tsx: `strokeWidth="4"`
- Changed string literals to numeric literals using curly braces: `strokeWidth={4}`
- Checked other SVG attributes (`r`, `cx`, `cy`, etc.) for similar stringâ†’number coercion issues
- Updated all instances to use proper TypeScript typing with numeric values
- Verified the fix with a successful build: `npm run build`
- Committed changes to main branch to trigger Railway deployment

### Reflection

This fix addresses a common TypeScript issue with SVG elements where React expects numeric values for certain attributes rather than string literals. While HTML typically uses strings for all attributes, React's strong typing requires proper numeric values for SVG properties like strokeWidth, r, cx, and cy. This ensures type safety and prevents runtime coercion issues.

The fix is simple but critical for maintaining a clean build pipeline and ensuring successful deployment to production environments. It's a good reminder to be vigilant about proper typing in JSX/TSX components, especially when working with SVG elements that have specific numeric attribute requirements.
