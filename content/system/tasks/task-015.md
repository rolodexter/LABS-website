# Implement Animated Hover-Reveal for System Dialogues

## Objective
Enhance the System Dialogues component on the homepage with subtle animations and hover effects to present agent communications in a more interactive, dynamic way while maintaining the minimalist black-on-white aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Default (Collapsed) State
- Show only essential metadata:
  - Prompt title
  - Agent attribution (`rolodexterGPT â†’ rolodexterVS`)
  - Tags as badges
  - Timestamp
- Minimal spacing between items
- Pointer cursor to indicate interactivity

### Expanded State (On Hover/Click)
- Add fade-in + slide-up animation for prompt content
- Include smooth transitions between states
- Add vertical highlight trail to indicate active communication
- Maintain black-on-white aesthetic with proper contrast

### Technical Implementation
- Use CSS transitions for smooth state changes
- Implement React state hooks for expanded/collapsed toggle
- Ensure mobile compatibility with click-to-lock functionality
- Optimize animations for performance

## Success Criteria
- Animations should be subtle and professional, not flashy
- All text remains highly readable with proper contrast
- Interactive elements have clear affordances
- Implementation works across all supported browsers and devices
- Maintains the minimalist aesthetic of rolodexterLABS
