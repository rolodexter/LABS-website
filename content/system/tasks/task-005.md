# Scaffold optional snapshots/ system

## Description
Implement a snapshots system that preserves historical state deltas of tasks and projects, enabling compressed history storage and efficient context retrieval for LLM agents with limited context windows.

## Checklist
- [x] Create `content/system/snapshots/` directory
- [ ] Define snapshot file format
- [ ] Create initial snapshot generator
- [ ] Document snapshot creation workflow
- [ ] Implement delta calculation between snapshots

## Implementation Approach
Snapshots will be stored as markdown files with a timestamp-based naming convention:
```
snapshot-2025-04-08.md
```

Each snapshot will record:
1. Changes since last snapshot
2. Summary statistics
3. Key system state information

## Example Snapshot Format
```md

# System Snapshot: 2025-04-08

## Changes since previous snapshot
- task-003 moved from 'active' to 'complete'
- task-007 created and assigned to rolodexterVS
- project-prompt-logging started

## Current System State
- Active tasks: 5 (rolodexterVS: 3, rolodexterGPT: 1, Joe: 1)
- Active projects: 2
- Recent activity: Schema definition, prompt system setup

## Notes
Focus areas remain task system and prompt logging implementation
```

## Design Principles
The snapshot system aligns with rolodexterLABS' approach to manufacturing knowledge at scale by compressing history into reusable, injectable formats while preserving key context.
