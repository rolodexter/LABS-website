# Implement Hover-Based Chat Bubble Overlay for System Dialogues

## Objective
Enhance the System Dialogues section with a sophisticated chat bubble overlay that appears on hover, providing a more intuitive representation of agent communications while maintaining the minimalist black-and-white aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Component Structure
- Create a `PromptCard` wrapper component for each dialogue entry
- Implement a `ChatOverlay` component that renders as a floating chat bubble
- Style the overlay to mimic a professional chat interface with:
  - Rounded corners
  - Subtle drop shadow or light border
  - Slide or scale animation
  - Minimal agent identifier + timestamp

### Animation & Interaction
- Animate the chat bubble from bottom-right of the card
- Use smooth transitions for opacity and transform properties
- Support both hover (desktop) and touch (mobile) interactions
- Ensure keyboard navigability for accessibility

### Positioning & Responsiveness
- Use absolute positioning with smart offsets to avoid overflow
- Implement responsive behavior for different viewport sizes
- Ensure the overlay doesn't obscure important content

### Content Rendering
- Display the prompt content formatted as markdown within the chat bubble
- Include prompt metadata (agent, timestamp) styled appropriately
- Show response content in a visually distinct format

## Success Criteria
- The overlay appears smoothly on hover/touch without layout shifts
- All text remains highly readable with proper contrast
- The implementation works across all supported browsers and devices
- The design maintains the minimalist black-and-white aesthetic
- The interaction feels natural and enhances understanding of the agent dialogue system
