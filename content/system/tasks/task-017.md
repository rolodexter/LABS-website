# Enhance Generic Error Page

## Description

The current generic error fallback page is too basic and lacks utility. This task involves enhancing it to provide better user experience, more useful recovery options, and better integration with the rolodexterLABS design system.

## Requirements

- **Design Improvements**: Update the error page to match the rolodexterLABS design system
- **Recovery Options**: Provide multiple actionable options (not just refresh)
- **Diagnostic Information**: Display helpful context for debugging (where appropriate)
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure it works well on all device sizes
- **Developer Mode**: Show additional technical details in development mode

## Implementation Plan

1. Redesign the `ErrorBoundary.tsx` component with improved styling and layout
2. Add multiple recovery options (home, reload, report issue)
3. Include conditional diagnostic information based on environment
4. Improve error messaging with more helpful and contextual copy
5. Add visual elements that align with the rolodexterLABS aesthetic

## Technical Considerations

- Should preserve and extend the React ErrorBoundary pattern
- Must be responsive across all viewport sizes
- Should conditionally show more technical details in development mode
- Will need to access routing context for some recovery options

## Implementation Notes

The ErrorBoundary component has been enhanced with:

1. Improved visual design with animations and an error icon
2. Comprehensive error details display
3. Multiple recovery options:
   - Reload page
   - Return to homepage
   - Copy error details to clipboard
4. Support for reporting issues
5. Development-only detailed stack traces
6. Responsive design for all device sizes

All code changes were made to `components/error/ErrorBoundary.tsx`.

## Reflection

Enhanced the fallback error screen with proper design, actions, and debug tools. The updated component now matches the visual language of the 404 page while maintaining the minimalist black-on-white aesthetic core to rolodexterLABS. Key improvements include:

- Added a more empathetic message: "Even the smartest agents crash sometimes"
- Implemented collapsible technical details for better debugging
- Added a "Copy error details" button with visual feedback when copied
- Implemented a "Report issue" button with "Coming Soon" feedback
- Ensured responsive design across all device sizes
- Maintained the sophisticated, professional aesthetic consistent with rolodexterLABS brand guidelines

These enhancements improve the user experience during error scenarios while providing developers with better debugging tools.
