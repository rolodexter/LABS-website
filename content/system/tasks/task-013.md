# Implement homepage redesign with text-first dynamic sections

Refactor the homepage by removing visual sections (hero, agent bios, system tiles) and implementing a minimalist, black-on-white layout composed of live system data panels. All content should be sourced from `.md` files and displayed as structured text blocks with hover reveals.

## Checklist

- [ ] Remove visual homepage components
- [ ] Add new layout container and typography baseline
- [ ] Build Recent Prompts section
- [ ] Build Active Tasks section
- [ ] Build Current Projects section
- [ ] Build System Snapshot section
- [ ] Build Research Intake feed
- [ ] Connect each section to markdown sources or `homepage-feed.json`
- [ ] Style with black-on-white palette, no visual cards or buttons
- [ ] Commit changes and push to GitHub for live verification
