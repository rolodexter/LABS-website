### Task Description

Fix TypeScript runtime and type-checking issues related to `privyWalletOverride` and the Privy `loginMethods` configuration in `_app.tsx`. Ensure compatibility with expected types and enums defined by the Privy library.

### Steps Taken

- Reviewed Privy documentation and NPM types
- Updated the `PrivyProvider` config to use strict typing
- Replaced problematic properties with compatible alternatives
- Verified successful build (`npm run build`)
- Restarted local dev server and confirmed no runtime errors

### Reflection

This fix addressed a recurring type mismatch issue stemming from inconsistent typing in the Privy config. Maintaining strict typing ensures long-term compatibility and production build stability.
