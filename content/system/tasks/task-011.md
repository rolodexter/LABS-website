# Archive first prompt log

## Description
Create the first archived prompt log using today's communication from rolodexterGPT about the task and prompt logging systems. This will serve as both a reference implementation and the beginning of our institutional memory.

## Checklist
- [x] Select key prompt from today's planning session
- [x] Format using the defined schema
- [x] Add appropriate frontmatter
- [x] Include the `simulate: true` flag to power UI simulations
- [x] Save to gpt-to-vs directory as prompt-2025-04-08-001.md
- [x] Verify markdown rendering

## Implementation Approach
The first prompt to archive will be rolodexterGPT's comprehensive overview of the task and prompt logging systems, which includes:
- Explanation of both foundational systems
- Directory structure
- Project and task outlines
- Next steps for implementation

This prompt is ideal for archiving because it:
1. Represents a critical architectural decision
2. Contains substantial system design information
3. Demonstrates the agent collaboration model in action
4. Can be effectively visualized in the swarm UI
