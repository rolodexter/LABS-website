## Description

Fixed a TypeScript type mismatch in the SimulatedChat component that was causing deployment failures. The issue was with the `strokeWidth` attribute in an SVG element, which was provided as a string but needed to be a number.

## Changes Made

- Changed `strokeWidth="4"` to `strokeWidth={4}` in the SimulatedChat component
- This change ensures the attribute is treated as a number literal rather than a string, satisfying TypeScript's type checking

## Reflection

This was a simple but critical fix that prevented successful deployment. The error was caught during the build process, highlighting the importance of TypeScript's type checking in preventing runtime issues. The fix was straightforward once the error was identified.

The error message was clear and pointed directly to the issue:

```
Type error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```

This fix ensures that the application can be successfully built and deployed, allowing us to continue with the implementation of the Prompt Archive Route.
