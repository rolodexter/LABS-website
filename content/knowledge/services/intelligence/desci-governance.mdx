# DeSci Governance: Coordination Mechanisms for Decentralized Science

Decentralized Science (DeSci) governance represents a fundamental shift in how scientific research is organized, funded, and validated. By leveraging distributed coordination technologies, DeSci creates new possibilities for scientific collaboration that transcend traditional institutional boundaries.

## DAO-Based Research Coordination

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) provide flexible frameworks for scientific collaboration:

### Structural Models

- **Research DAOs**: Organizations focused on specific scientific domains or research questions
- **Protocol DAOs**: Governance structures for scientific infrastructure and tools
- **Funding DAOs**: Entities dedicated to resource allocation for scientific work

### Coordination Mechanisms

- **Proposal Systems**: Structured processes for suggesting, evaluating, and approving research directions
- **Reputation Systems**: Methods for tracking contribution quality and expertise
- **Task Markets**: Mechanisms for matching scientific work with qualified contributors

### Implementation Patterns

- **Working Groups**: Semi-autonomous teams focused on specific research components
- **Nested DAOs**: Hierarchical structures allowing specialization while maintaining coherence
- **Fluid Participation**: Models allowing researchers to contribute across multiple projects

## Funding Models for Open Science

Novel economic mechanisms enable more efficient resource allocation:

### Quadratic Funding

- **Preference Aggregation**: Mathematical frameworks for capturing collective funding preferences
- **Sybil Resistance**: Mechanisms to prevent manipulation of collective funding decisions
- **Implementation Variants**: Adaptations of quadratic funding for specific scientific contexts

### Retroactive Public Goods Funding (retroPGF)

- **Impact Verification**: Methods for assessing the realized value of completed research
- **Citation Markets**: Systems that reward influential scientific contributions after publication
- **Knowledge Commons**: Frameworks for maintaining and funding shared scientific resources

### Hypercerts

- **Fractional Ownership**: Models for representing partial claims on scientific outcomes
- **Impact Certificates**: Tokenized representations of positive scientific externalities
- **Composable Funding**: Building blocks for complex research funding arrangements

## Governance Tooling for Open Science

Technical infrastructure enabling decentralized scientific governance:

### Decision Systems

- **Voting Mechanisms**: Specialized voting systems for scientific consensus formation
- **Deliberation Platforms**: Tools for structured scientific discourse and debate
- **Parameter Governance**: Frameworks for collectively managing scientific protocols

### Transparency Infrastructure

- **Open Peer Review**: Systems for transparent evaluation of scientific claims
- **Contribution Tracking**: Methods for attributing and verifying scientific work
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable records of scientific processes and decisions

### Interoperability Standards

- **Governance Primitives**: Modular building blocks for scientific coordination
- **Cross-DAO Collaboration**: Protocols for cooperation between scientific organizations
- **Governance Marketplaces**: Platforms for sharing and adapting governance mechanisms
