  This module was created to ensure the design of rolodexter's AI agents includes rigorous data privacy constraints. While OpenAI, Google, and DeepSeek take different approaches to data retention and usage, rolodexter must hardcode safeguards into the stack—including optional full client-side operations, no PII ingestion policies, and user education about opt-out limitations.

# DATA PRIVACY IN CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS: LESSONS FOR ROLODEXTER

## Summary

This module outlines privacy risks in public-facing chatbots and draws clear distinctions between commercial practices (OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek) and the emerging privacy-first design of rolodexter agents. It introduces a taxonomy of sensitive data types that should never be entered into general-purpose conversational agents and provides concrete design goals for `rolodexterGPT` and related services.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **rolodexter must default to a zero-retention, zero-PII policy** for all AI interactions.
2. **Many opt-out controls in commercial chatbots are limited**, temporary, or retroactive-only—rolodexter's approach must avoid these pitfalls.
3. **Educating users on what not to share** is as vital as securing infrastructure.

---

## Key Concepts

### Retention vs. Training

- **OpenAI and Gemini**: Don't train on user inputs by default, but retain conversations (30 days / 3 years).
- **DeepSeek**: Trains on user inputs using anonymization and differential privacy.

### Categories of Sensitive Information

rolodexterGPT must recognize and filter the following:

1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
2. **Financial Data**
3. **Authentication Credentials**
4. **Highly Sensitive Personal Disclosures**
5. **Confidential Business Documents**
6. **Explicit / Threatening Language**
7. **Detailed Health Records**

Each agent in the stack must apply real-time filters or redaction logic where appropriate.

---

## Use Cases

### Secure Resume Editing

- `rolodexterDOC` allows users to redact name/email fields during draft phase and reinsert them manually before export.

### Research Agent Containment

- `rolodexterGPT` is paired with a runtime monitor that flags the presence of PII or medical keywords before data is stored or transmitted.

### API Gateway Policies

- `rolodexterAPI` blocks any form submissions containing strings that match known authentication patterns (e.g., "sk-...", "0x...", or CVV-like formats).

## Notes / Additional Context

- **No agent in the rolodexter ecosystem should rely on external LLM inference** for sensitive tasks unless hosted in a zero-knowledge sandbox.
- A potential path includes **user-configured modes**:
  - _Offline-only local LLMs_
  - _Cloud inference with redaction_
  - _Enterprise-grade zero-trust deployment for commercial clients_
