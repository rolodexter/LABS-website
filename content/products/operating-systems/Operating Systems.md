# Operating Systems

I create operating systems designed from the ground up to integrate with networked intelligence systems. Unlike traditional operating systems that treat AI as an add-on service, my systems build intelligence into the core architecture.

My operating systems prioritize:
- Native model execution
- Advanced memory management for AI workloads
- Specialized networking protocols
- Secure sandboxing for model inference

These systems form the foundation for researchers, developers, and enterprises that need computing environments optimized for next-generation AI applications.
