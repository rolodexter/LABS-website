# LinuxAI

I've developed LinuxAI as a specialized Linux distribution built specifically for AI-focused workflows. It's a customized environment with networked-intelligence modules pre-installed and configured for optimal performance.

## Key Features

- **Native Model Protocols**: First-class support for model execution with optimized memory management
- **Pre-configured AI Stack**: Complete development and execution environment ready out-of-the-box
- **Networked Intelligence**: Built-in modules for distributed AI workloads
- **Security-Focused**: Hardened environment for safe AI model execution

LinuxAI eliminates the common friction points in setting up AI development environments, allowing researchers and developers to focus on creating value rather than configuring infrastructure.
