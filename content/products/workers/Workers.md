# Workers

I build specialized AI workers designed to augment human capabilities across various domains and workflows. Each worker focuses on a specific expertise area, combining frontier AI with domain-specific knowledge.

My worker systems operate on a consistent architecture that prioritizes:
- Executive function intelligence
- Knowledge manufacturing at scale
- Specialized task execution
- Human-AI collaborative interfaces

These workers form a cohesive ecosystem, allowing for both independent operation and coordinated workflows when more complex tasks require multiple specialized capabilities working in concert.
