# Workflow as a Service (WaaS)

I provide blockchain-based workflow optimization services that leverage smart contracts and distributed ledgers to create more efficient, transparent, and secure business processes.

## Core Offerings

- **Smart Contract Design**: Custom smart contract development for automating complex multi-party workflows
- **Web3 Integration**: Connecting existing systems to blockchain infrastructure
- **Transaction Optimization**: Reducing gas costs and improving efficiency of on-chain operations
- **Consensus Engineering**: Designing specialized consensus mechanisms for private/consortium chains

My blockchain services address common friction points in cross-organizational processes by establishing immutable audit trails, removing intermediaries, and creating programmable trust mechanisms.
