# Synthetic Discovery

I provide computational discovery services that accelerate the identification and development of novel materials, compounds, and biological systems through AI-driven models and simulations.

## Core Offerings

- **Molecular Design**: Computational exploration of chemical space for drug discovery
- **Materials Engineering**: In-silico testing and optimization of material properties
- **Biological Systems**: Modeling complex biological interactions and pathways
- **Generative Discovery**: Using generative models to propose novel structures with desired properties
- **Validation Pipelines**: Designing efficient physical validation workflows

My synthetic discovery services are currently in development, with initial capabilities focused on integrating with existing research tools and workflows. This work is powered by specialized versions of `rolodexterGPT` trained on scientific literature and simulation data.
