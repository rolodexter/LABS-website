## RUNTIME PROMPT FOR roldexterVS

You're resuming work on the public website for **rolodexterLABS**: [https://www.rolodexterlabs.com](https://www.rolodexterlabs.com). This is a Railway-deployed Next.js app.

### ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES

1. **Fix Dashboard Bug**  
   - Current build fails due to `user.email` typing mismatch.  
   - Update logic so all fallback values are guaranteed strings.  
   - Also ensure dashboard doesn't break if user is undefined.

2. **Hide Dashboard Link**
   - Move dashboard access out of main view.
   - Replace with a **very subtle "Login" link** in the **upper-right corner** of the site, preferably inside the top nav.
   - Visitors should not feel like they're expected to sign in â€” they're here to *learn about rolodexterLABS*, not use a product.

3. **Fix the Footer**
   - There's a **duplicate footer** rendering on some pages.
   - Ensure the footer is rendered exactly once on each route.

4. **Enforce Black-on-White Theme**
   - The entire site should feel like reading a well-designed technical document.
   - Use **black text on white background** as default. Remove green or dark backgrounds unless explicitly used for cards or charts.

5. **Enable Login**
   - Ensure that the **Privy-based login system** appears when "Login" is clicked.
   - Login options should include: Web3 Wallet, Google, GitHub, Social Logins.
   - No redirect required â€” modal or top-right dropdown is fine.
