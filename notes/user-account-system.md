Below is a **high-level plan** for designing a user account system that supports **multiple login flows**—including standard web2 methods like Google/GitHub OAuth and **web3 wallet** authentication (e.g., MetaMask, Phantom). I’ll outline both **conceptual** and **technical** considerations for a robust, scalable solution.

---

## 1. Overview of Requirements

1. **Multi-Provider Login**  
   - **Traditional OAuth**: Google, GitHub, etc.  
   - **Web3 Wallet**: MetaMask (Ethereum), Phantom (Solana), etc.  
   - **Custom Email + Password**: Possibly optional if you want direct credential-based sign-up as well.

2. **Unified User Profile**  
   - Each user should have one “account” in your system, regardless of how they log in (wallet vs. Google).  
   - You’ll handle linking multiple auth methods to one user entity so they can log in with either their wallet or their Google account.

3. **Secure Storage**  
   - Typically, user profiles are in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.).  
   - Store user metadata and authentication data (like OAuth tokens, wallet addresses, etc.) in a robust, secure manner.

4. **Session Management**  
   - Provide a consistent session/token approach so the user remains logged in across different providers.  
   - Usually done with JWT tokens, session cookies, or similar.

5. **Extensibility**  
   - Possibly add more identity providers later (Twitter, Discord, Apple, etc.).  
   - Possibly store additional user data like roles, preferences, or subscription info.

## 3. Approaches to Multiple Login Methods

### A. Use an Auth Service (Auth0, Firebase, etc.)

1. **Auth0**:  
   - Provides easy “Login with Google,” “Login with GitHub,” etc.  
   - Has advanced **Web3** login flows, or you can integrate with third-party libraries that handle wallet signatures.  
   - Simplifies token issuance, session management, user linking.  
   - You store user profile data in Auth0 or use an external DB linked to Auth0 user IDs.

2. **Firebase Authentication**:  
   - Built-in providers for Google, GitHub, and more.  
   - Web3 integration is less direct but can be done by verifying wallet signatures externally, then calling Firebase custom auth tokens.  

**Pros**: Quick to set up, well-documented, built-in security, easy expansions to more providers.  
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, monthly fees after certain usage, less direct control over the entire flow.

---

### B. Roll Your Own OAuth + Web3

If you want full control or want to **self-host everything**:

1. **OAuth2 for Google/GitHub**  
   - Implement or use a library (e.g., Passport.js in Node, or python-social-auth in Python) for each provider’s OAuth flow.  
   - On success, get the user’s email/username from Google/GitHub, then either create or find a user record in your DB.  
   - Generate a session token (JWT or cookie) for the user to stay logged in.  

2. **Web3 Wallet Auth**  
   - Typically involves a **signature challenge**: 
     1. The server generates a random nonce.  
     2. The user’s wallet signs the nonce with their private key.  
     3. The server verifies the signature with the user’s public key, ensuring it’s the correct wallet.  
     4. Once verified, the user is “logged in” as the owner of that wallet address.  
   - You can store that wallet address in your database as a unique identifier.  

3. **Linking**  
   - If you want a single user to have both a wallet address and an OAuth account, you can store them in the same user row or separate “AuthMethod” table. For example:
     ```
     User Table: 
       id, email, created_at, updated_at, etc.

     AuthMethod Table:
       id, user_id, provider (e.g. 'google', 'wallet'), 
       provider_id (e.g. user’s google ID or wallet address),
       created_at, updated_at
     ```
   - So if a user logs in first with Google, they get a user record. If they later sign in with a wallet, you detect that the email matches or let them “link” the wallet to the same user record.

**Pros**: Full control, no vendor fees, deep customization.  
**Cons**: More dev time, must handle security carefully (nonce generation, store hashed refresh tokens, etc.).

## 4. Storing User Data Securely

1. **Database Choice**:  
   - SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB).  
   - Keep a `users` table/collection with the user’s main profile data.  
   - Keep an `auth_methods` table/collection for each login method.  
2. **Sensitive Data**:  
   - For OAuth, you typically store tokens in a secure manner (or short-lived in memory) if you need to call the provider’s API later.  
   - For password-based logins, store salted + hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).  
3. **Wallet Addresses**:  
   - Usually store them as strings.  
   - You also store a hashed “nonce” for verifying the next time they sign in, or you generate a new nonce each session.

---

## 5. Session / Token Strategy

1. **Token-based** (JWT)  
   - On login success, server returns a signed JWT with user info (ID, roles, etc.).  
   - The client includes this JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer` header for subsequent requests.  
   - The server verifies the JWT signature on each request.  

2. **Cookie-based**  
   - Server sets an HTTP-only secure cookie with a session ID or JWT.  
   - Good for same-origin web apps.  
   - Make sure to protect against XSRF if you do so.

3. **Refresh Tokens**  
   - If you need persistent login, consider short-lived access tokens plus refresh tokens in your DB so you can rotate them.  
   - Or rely on the Auth0-like approach that handles refresh tokens behind the scenes.

---

## 6. Web3-Specific Nuances

1. **Signature Security**  
   - Always generate a random **nonce** that’s time-limited or single-use so it can’t be replayed.  
   - Confirm the signature matches the public address.  
2. **Different Chains**  
   - **MetaMask** → Ethereum-based (EVM).  
   - **Phantom** → Solana.  
   - Each chain has its own way of verifying signatures or addresses, but the general concept is the same.  
3. **Optional On-Chain Verification**  
   - In some advanced cases, you might store the user’s unique ID on-chain or do token gating (like checking NFT ownership).  
   - This is beyond basic login but can be integrated if needed.

---

## 7. Example Workflow

**User chooses “Login with Google”**  
1. Frontend directs them to your server’s `/auth/google` endpoint (or uses the Google OAuth flow).  
2. Google returns an OAuth callback with user’s ID/email.  
3. Your server checks DB for an existing user with that Google ID.  
   - If found, log them in by issuing a session token.  
   - If not, create a new user row, then issue a token.  
4. Return the user to the site with a valid session.

**User chooses “Login with Wallet (MetaMask)”**  
1. Frontend requests a nonce from the server with `/auth/wallet/nonce?address=0x123...`.  
2. Server generates a random nonce, stores it in DB along with that wallet address.  
3. Frontend asks the user to **sign** the nonce with MetaMask.  
4. User’s wallet returns a signature.  
5. Frontend sends the signature + wallet address to your server: `/auth/wallet/verify`.  
6. Server verifies the signature to ensure it matches the stored nonce + the user’s wallet.  
7. If valid, server checks DB if that wallet address is already linked to a user.  
   - If yes, logs them in, issues session token.  
   - If no, create a new user record or ask user if they want to link to an existing account.  
8. Clear or invalidate the nonce after use.

## 8. Implementation Tips

1. **Libraries**: 
   - **Node**: Use [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) or [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for a quick start with multiple providers.  
   - **Python**: [Authlib](https://docs.authlib.org/) or [python-social-auth](https://github.com/python-social-auth).  
   - For web3, you can use [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) or [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) on the client to sign messages, then verify on the server with [ethers.js verify logic](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/single-page/#/v5/api/utils/strings/-%23-utils-verifyMessage) or any standard signature library.

2. **Linking Accounts**:
   - If a user logs in first with Google, they have a user record. If they later connect a wallet, you add that wallet to their `auth_methods`. Possibly let them do this in “Account Settings → Connect your wallet.”  
   - Similarly, if they log in with a wallet first, you might let them connect a Google account later.

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Use HTTPS to protect tokens in transit.  
   - Implement [CSRF] or [CORS] as needed.  
   - Use short TTL for JWTs if feasible, plus refresh tokens if you want “remember me” functionality.  
   - Validate email if needed for certain features (like receiving notifications).

4. **Scalability**:
   - If you anticipate lots of traffic, ensure your solution (Auth0 or self-hosted) can handle concurrency.  
   - For self-hosted, you might add a load balancer.  
   - DB design should handle relationships (one user → many auth methods) gracefully.

## 9. Putting It All Together

**Minimal Example**:
- Use **NextAuth** (if building in Next.js) or **Passport.js** (if building in Express) for Google/GitHub logins.  
- Write a small custom “wallet login” route that performs the signature challenge.  
- Store everything in a user table with relationships to each auth method.  
- Issue a JWT or session cookie after successful login.

**More Comprehensive**:
- An **Auth0** or **Firebase** approach that can handle both web2 and custom web3 flows, though you may have to implement the wallet signature logic yourself or rely on an extension library.

By following these steps, you’ll have a robust system where visitors can **register and log in** using *any* method they prefer—**wallet-based** or **OAuth**. The system unifies them under a single user profile, ensuring a smooth user experience and simpler management on your end.
